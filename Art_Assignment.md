# Data-Driven Art Assignment  

## Objective  
Create a **handmade** piece of art inspired by a dataset of your choice. The goal is to transform data into a visual form that conveys meaning beyond numbers.  

## Guidelines  
- **Choose a dataset** that interests you—it can be about anything (science, society, nature, music, personal interests, etc.).  
- **Create a physical artwork** (painting, drawing, watercolor, collage, or other traditional media—no digital art).  
- The artwork should be **larger than 8x10 inches** in size.  
- Your art should **reflect something from the data**, whether patterns, relationships, trends, or emotions.  
- Include a **brief (3-5 sentence) explanation** of how your work connects to the dataset.  

## Submission  
- **Bring your artwork to class** and submit it to the faculty.  
- **Share your dataset** (a link or a short description of where it came from).  
- Be prepared to **discuss your process and interpretation** with the class.  

## Grading Criteria (All Submissions Earn Full Credit, with Recognition for Outstanding Work)  

✅ **Thoughtful Data Selection** – The dataset is clearly chosen with intent, and the student can explain why it was interesting or meaningful.  

✅ **Creative Artistic Representation** – The artwork effectively translates data into a visual form, using color, shape, or structure to reflect the dataset.  

✅ **Effort & Execution** – The student has put noticeable effort into their work, whether through detail, technique, or depth of concept.  

✅ **Connection to Data** – The student provides a short explanation (3-5 sentences) of how the artwork relates to the dataset.  

⭐ **Special Recognition:** Exceptional pieces that go beyond expectations in creativity, execution, or concept may receive in-class recognition or be displayed in a showcase.
