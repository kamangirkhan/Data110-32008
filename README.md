## Weekly Overview


 ### [Week 1: Introduction to Data Visualization and Tools](Week1.md)
 **Summary**:
- Introduction to the course, syllabus, and key tools for communication.
- Focus on collecting and visualizing data using Google Forms.
- Introduction to GitHub and Markdown for documentation.

### [Week 2: Scatter Plot, Google Colab](Week2.md)
**Summary**: 
- **Google Colab**: Get acquainted with **Google Colab** as a powerful cloud-based platform for writing and executing Python code. Learn how to create and manage notebooks for data analysis and visualization.

- **Python Basics**: Introduction to fundamental Python concepts, including variables, data types, loops, and basic data structures. Start writing simple Python scripts to manipulate and analyze data.


### [Week 3: Scatter Plot with Matplotlib in Python](week3.md)
**Summary**:
- Summary: Introduction to **Matplotlib** for creating line and scatter plots in Python. Learn to customize plots with different styles, colors, and markers, and visualize various mathematical functions using these fundamental plotting techniques.


### [Week 4: Bar Graph with Matplotlib](week4.md)

**Summary**:

**Week Focus**: Using bar graphs to compare numerical values across categories.
- Bar Graph Types:
  -  Simple Bar Charts: Individual amounts; start y-axis at zero.
  -   Grouped Bar Charts: Compare values within a category.
  -   Stacked Bar Charts: Show parts of a whole.



### [Week 5: Histograms and KDE with Matplotlib](Week5.md)

**Summary**:

**Week Focus**: Visualizing distributions I using histograms and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
- Plot Types:
  - **Histograms**: Represent frequency of data within bins; adjust bin width for better clarity.
  - **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: Smooths data to show continuous distribution trends.
  - **Stacked Histograms**: Display how parts of a dataset contribute to the whole, stacked across different categories.
  - **Combined KDE**: Overlay multiple KDE plots to compare distributions for different categories.
  - **Combined Histograms**: Overlay multiple histograms with transparency to compare distributions across categories (e.g., male vs. female).
